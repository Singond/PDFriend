preprocess_cellSize_resolve=Resolving cell dimensions for {} with following settings: {}
preprocess_cellSize_resolvePref=Determining preferred cell size
preprocess_cellSize_fromPageScale=Circumscribing the cell to the all pages of the document scaled by {} and rotated by {}
preprocess_cellSize_fromPageDimensions=Circumscribing the cell to a rectangle of {} rotated by {}
preprocess_cellSize_explicit=Cell size has been explicitly given as {}
preprocess_cellSize_result=Cell dimensions set to {}
preprocess_pageScale_default=No page size or scale given. Using default value of {}
preprocess_pageScale_explicit=Page scale has been explicitly given as {}
preprocess_pageScale_fromPage=Determining page scale from page size: Page size is {}, resulting scale is {}
preprocess_pageSize_fromPage=Page box is equal to page boundary
preprocess_pageSize_fromPageAndScale=Page size ambiguity: Scale has been set to {} and page dimensions have been set to {} ({} times larger than the original). \
Page box is {} times the size of the page.

preprocess_pageSize_fromScale=Determining page size from scale (scale = {})
preprocess_pageSize_cell=Positioning page of size {} into cell of size {}
preprocess_page_resizeNone=
preprocess_page_resizeFit=Fitting rectangle {} into cell
preprocess_page_resizeFill=Filling cell by rectangle {}
preprocess_page_calculated=Position of rectangle {} is {}
preprocess_page_position=Pre-processing page {}: transforming by {}

leaf_degeneratePosition=Bad position of leaf {}. The matrix has zero determinant; this means the page will degenerate to a single line or point
leaf_mirroredFront=Unlikely position of leaf {}. The leaf is mirrored.
leaf_mirroredFront_detail=Leaf {}: The front position matrix has negative determinant; this means the page will be mirrored when printed.
leaf_mirroredBack=Unlikely position of leaf {}. The leaf is mirrored.
leaf_mirroredBack_detail=Leaf {}: The back position matrix has positive determinant; this means the page will be mirrored when printed.
leaf_rectoEven=Leaf {} is being numbered from even number. It is usual for leaf to be numbered from odd number.
# Progress

# Progress
page_rendering=Rendering page {} directly into a new virtual page

# Progress

signature_rendering=Rendering sheets of signature {}
signature_renderingSheet=Rendering sheet {}

# Progress
volume_rendering=Rendering volume {}
volume_saving=Saving {} to {}

stack_gatherOne=Stack manipulation: Number of Stacks to be gathered is one; this operation will not do anything.

layerSP_queueEmpty=There are no more source pages available for layer {} from page {} onwards
layerSP_tooManyLayersInPage=The layered page has {0} layers while this source provider only has {1}. \
Source pages will only be set for the lowest {1} layers.

# Booklet
booklet_constructing=Constructing a new Booklet of {} pages
booklet_padding=The number of pages in the booklet is not divisible by 4. To correct this, {} blank pages will be added to the end.
